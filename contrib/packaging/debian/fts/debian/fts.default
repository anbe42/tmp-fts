# Start the FTS process as a custom user. If you run FTS as a separate
# user, you need to take care about these things:
#
# * Make sure the user owns the configure TFTP directory
# * Make suer the user is able to read the static TFTP directory
# * Modify your fuse.conf to include the "user_allow_other" keyword
# * Make sure the user is in the fuse group
#
#DAEMON_USER=tftpd

# Use an alternate configuration file.
#CONFIG=/etc/fts/config
