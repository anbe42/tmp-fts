Quick installation guide
========================

It is recommended to install FTS as a package for your distribution. To
create a package, please take a look at the contrib/packaging/<distribution>
directory - if there's none for your favorite distribution, please
feel free to create a package ;-)

---

Installing from source involves these steps:

 * Make sure you've the python setuptools/distutils installed.

 * Running top-level "./setup.py install" as root installs FTS
   including all included modules to your systems python installation.

 * Running fts/setup.py and selected plugins/*/setup.py installs
   the 'core' and the selected plugins.

 * Create an init script (or take the one from
   contrib/packaging/debian/fts/debian/fts.init) and activate your
   service.
